<h1>Volunteer E-mail Utility</h1>
<p>With the introduction of the Volunteer Utility Database (VolDB) a new set of 'rules of the road' was established. This utility centers around the ability to create and manage volunteers and their asssoicated mailing lists that facioitate communication with PWC's volunteer corp.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the re-hosting of the membership and volunteer systems it is a great opportunity to re-visit the email lists and update them where appropriate - including the ownership of each.</p>
<p>You are getting this email because you are registered as a user OR have been identified as an owner of one or more of these lists. Your ownership merely means that you are being asked to manage those individuals on the list(s) that you are associated with.</p>
<p>List management is done by logging into the utility and accessing various volunteer records using their MCID and updating these records appropriately.</p>
<p>If a volunteer is no longer serving as an active volunteer their lists should be updated to include the 'Vol Inactive' setting to remove them from further email notices.  Volunteer's who do not belong to any mailing list should not be left as a Member Status of 2 (volunteer) but re-designated as a member or donor.</p>
<p>If you have questions please contact Dorothy Correa who can provide more information.</p>
<p>Here are the current lists defined and their designated owners:</p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" border=0>
  <tr><th>List Name</th><th>Curr Count</th><th>List Owner</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Office Admin List</td><td>15</td><td>Dorothy Correa</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Baby Bird Rehabbers</td><td>32</td><td>Vann Masdival</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Center List</td><td>120</td><td>Vann Masdival</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Rescue/Transport List</td><td>68</td><td>Bob Blakely</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Home Rehab List</td><td>29</td><td>Dorothy Correa</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Hotline List</td><td>41</td><td>Kelly Cherry</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Hotline Back-up List</td><td>9</td><td>Kelly Cherry</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>If you feel that you do not 'own' a list please let me know along with the name of the person who should be associated with it.</p>
<p>A new list can be defined by notifying either Dorothy Correa or Dave Klinzman.</p>
<p>Log into the volunteer utility at: <a href="http://apps.pacwilica.org/voldb/admin">apps.pacwilica.org/voldb/admin</a> using your email address and password. If you already have logged into the utility you are good to go. If you have not your initial password is 'raptor'. Change it to another if you like.</p>
<p>Your login allows you to update volunteer records (including the email lists they are subscribed to) and to send email messages to one or more lists defined. Other facilities and reports are also available. For example, you may review email messages, server email logs and other useful reports.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that when using the utility to send an email to one or more lists the email message will be sent from the email address of <a href="mailto:'vols@pacwilica.org">vols@pacwilica.org</a>. This is done to reduce the likelihood of our message being treated as SPAM in the Internet email world.</p>
<p>However, if someone on your list merely clicks the 'REPLY' button of their email reader the reply will be sent to thein-box at <a href="mailto:vols@pacwilica.org">vols@pacwilica.org</a>.</p>
<p>In order to read these reply messages, you have to log into the the mail server at pacwilica.org.&nbsp; This is the URL to do that: <a href="https://pacwilica.org/roundcube/">https://pacwilica.org/roundcube</a></p>
<p>There are several in-boxes set up for different message responses.&nbsp; Your login will determine which in-box you will access.&nbsp; Here are the user ids and associated passwords.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Responses to emails sent to one or more	volunteer lists - <a href="mailto:vols@pacwilica.org">vols@pacwilica.org</a>, password: volspwc </li>
	<li>Responses to emails sent to 'Sat' list only
	(Home Rehab List) - <a href="mailto:pwchomerehab@pacwilica.org">pwchomerehab@pacwilica.org</a>,
	password: homerh</li>
	<li>Responses to email sent from the MbrDB
	Reminders system - <a href="mailto:remind@pacwilica.org">reminders@pacwilica.org</a>,
	password: remind </li>
	<li>Responses to email sent from the BMU system -
	<a href="mailto:pwcnews@pacwilica.org">pwcnews@pacwilica.org</a>,
	password: pwcnews2</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended that if you create a message to be sent by one of PWC's utilities AND you expect responses that you log in and check for responses AND DELETE them once you have noted the response.</p>
<p>These changes will, hopefully, allow PWC to continue to use this inexpensive and effective method to communicate with its support community.</p>
<p>Finally, it is incumbent on everyone to monitor these in-boxes for 'undelivered' messages.&nbsp; These messages are usually the result of the mail server OF THE RECIPIENT not accepting the message.&nbsp; Please, read these messages and correct the problem - usually a bad email address (which is easily fixed!)&nbsp; Once fixed - delete the error message along with any other that is
not needed.&nbsp; Good housekeeping makes it easier for everyone.</p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b></p>
<p>If you choose NOT to use the utility to send your email message to your volunteers you may use your own email facilities. HOWEVER, please maintain the lists on the utility for the benefit of the organization.</p>
<p>To facilitate using your own email facility use the 'List Mgr â†’ View Specific List' and select the list needed. At the bottom of the listing is a paragraph of all emails in the list to facilitate a copy/paste into your email program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WARNING: use of your own email facility may cause your email address to be identified as a SPAM creator and black-listed. This would not be a good thing and is the reason that the volunteer utility is provided for this use.</p>
<p>This document will be available in the 'Reports' menu.</p>
